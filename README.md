# Global Destinations

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

<a href="https://vinguyen3747.github.io/Global-destinations/">LIVE DEMO</a>

## Description
This is a ReactJs based web application. I have built this app using <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/">Mapbox GL JS</a>. Data is retrieved from <a href="https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api-reference/venues/explore/">Venue Recommendations endpoint </a> provided by FourSquare, which offers a global database based on over 105 million places available around the world. The FourSquare That is why I have used <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api">OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API </a>to convert input cities into geographic coordinates.

Users can also get reviews about the place by clicking on the marker. Reviews are retrieved via FourSquare's Venue Tips endpoint.
